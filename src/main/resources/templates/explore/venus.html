        <p class="h5">Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty.
            As the second-brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and, rarely,
            is visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit, and so never appears
            to venture far from the Sun, setting in the west just after dusk and rising in the east a bit before dawn.
            Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. With a rotation period of 243 Earth days, it takes longer
            to rotate about its axis than any planet in the Solar System and goes in the opposite direction to all but
            Uranus (meaning the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east). Venus does not have any natural
            satellites, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among planets in the Solar System.</p>
