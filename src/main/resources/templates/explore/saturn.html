        <p class="h5">Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.
            It is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. It has only one-eighth the
            average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.
            Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (â™„) represents the
            god's sickle.</p>
