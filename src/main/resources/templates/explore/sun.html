        <p class="h5">The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot
            plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far
            the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 1.39 million kilometers
            (864,000 miles), or 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth. It accounts
            for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. Roughly three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of
            hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements,
            including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.</p>
